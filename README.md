# Continual Self-supervised Domain Adaptation for End-to-end Speaker Diarization

This is the companion repository for the paper *[Continual Self-supervised Domain Adaptation for End-to-end Speaker Diarization](/paper.pdf)* by by [Juan Manuel Coria](https://juanmc2005.github.io/), [Hervé Bredin](https://herve.niderb.fr), [Sahar Ghannay](https://saharghannay.github.io/) and [Sophie Rosset](https://perso.limsi.fr/rosset/).

> In conventional domain adaptation for speaker diarization, a large collection of annotated conversations from the target domain is required. In this work, we propose a novel continual training scheme for domain adaptation of an end-to-end speaker diarization system, which processes one conversation at a time and benefits from full self-supervision thanks to pseudo-labels. The qualities of our method allow for autonomous adaptation (e.g. of a voice assistant to a new household), while also avoiding permanent storage of possibly sensitive user conversations. We experiment extensively on the 11 domains of the DIHARD III corpus and show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to a pre-trained baseline, achieving a relative 17% performance improvement. We also find that data augmentation and a well-defined target domain are key factors to avoid divergence and to benefit from transfer.

## Install

1) Create environment:

```shell
conda create -n csda python==3.8
conda activate csda
```

2) Install the latest PyTorch version following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally)

4) Install dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prepare your data

- Prepare your data-loading protocol using [pyannote.database](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-database). For continual adaptation experiments, the files in the training subset will form the training sequence in the order they appear.
- Download noise and impulse response datasets.

## Run an experiment

- Use `run_ours.py` to reproduce the results from our training scheme
- Use `run_whole.py` to reproduce the results from non-continual systems

By default the initial model will be the one we pre-trained on AMI with true-label supervision. You can replace it using the `--model` argument.
For more information on script arguments see `run_ours.py -h` or `run_whole.py -h`
